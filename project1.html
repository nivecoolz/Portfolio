                <h2>Scalable Data Management System</h2>
                <p>
                    This project involves building a scalable data management system using Azure services.
                    The project integrates multiple database technologies, including PostgreSQL and Azure SQL, to provide efficient data handling capabilities. The system is
                    designed to handle large-scale data processing tasks while ensuring data security and high performance.

                <h2>Healthcare Analytics</h2>
                <p>
                    Involved analyzing patient wait times to identify inefficiencies in the healthcare system. Large datasets were processed using SQL to extract relevant information from hospital systems. DAX was employed within Power BI to create interactive dashboards that tracked wait time metrics in real-time. Regression models were applied to determine the factors contributing to delays, helping to optimize operations. The analysis resulted in a 15% reduction in average wait times, improving both efficiency and patient satisfaction.
